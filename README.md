[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/TheBlackBeans/beans.svg?branch=rust-dev)](https://travis-ci.com/TheBlackBeans/beans)

Beans is a dynamic programing language, which means its syntax may change during compilation time,
and adapts to different type of compilation different syntaxes require. It may handle static typing as dynamic typing.

/!\ Warning: Beans is still in pre-release and all its features may not be done or fully operational yet. /!\

This project is maintained by TheBlackBeans.
